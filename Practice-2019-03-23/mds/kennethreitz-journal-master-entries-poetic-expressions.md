# Poetic Expressions

Here are a selection of poems I wrote, hastily, the other morning, on paper. They are mostly inspired by my experiences with bipolar disorder.

## 1

Eternal discomforting  
ever comforting  
the change  
always present  
never arrives  

## 2

Present tense  
half aware at best  
constant trains of mystery running through the mind  
seeking answers to eternal questions  
always more to find  

never content — always complacent  
the happiness begins  
the hope of a resting place for  
my mind, soul, body  
ensured

Poetic expressions  
  a foreign concept to the popular mind  
our busy lives prioritize  
  fulfillment in capitalistic ways  
Inherently… it is what it is.  

The words flow from mind to page  
as breath fills the lungs  
the rhyme, not given  
the patterns, hidden  

Welcome to my world.  

##  4

Questioning the foundations of the fabric of your seven senses  
A healthy state of mind  
forced upon by imbalances of the chemical kind  

imbalances that lead  
imbalances that teach  
imbalances that heal  
with the help of western medicine, of course
