TL;DR: At the TechLady Hackathon, I wanted to share the blogs in my data viz folder with another attendee, and I've put the full list here, so I can get my Github sea legs at the same time.  Feel free to add comments/other resources.

**Currently Reading**
*I don't check all of these individually, I use [Feedly](http://feedly.com/) as my RSS reader, so all the updates show up in one place.  I find it really helpful to just see a lot of visualization, so I'm more imaginative with my own data*

* [chartsnthings](http://chartsnthings.tumblr.com/) - A person from the NYT graphics team shares sketchs, in progress notes from their charts.  I like getting to see how they draft and refine their projects.

* [eagereyes](http://eagereyes.org/) - An employee at Tableau shares design tips and resources
* [Naomi Robbins (Forbes)](http://www.forbes.com/sites/naomirobbins/) - Design tips and occasional chart redesign contests
* [Flowing Data](http://flowingdata.com/) - Helpful discussions of good or bad inforgraphics and why they work/don't work.  Tutorials in R.
* [Junk Charts](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/) - This blogger finds bad/misleading charts, walks you through what's wrong, and sometimes does redesigns
* [Excel Charts](http://www.excelcharts.com/blog/) - You can get a lot more design out of Excel than you'd suspect
