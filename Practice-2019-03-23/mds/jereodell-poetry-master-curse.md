# Curse

Shadow of the man who fled his daughter,  
hid in the darker corners of her dreams,

shade of the father, thin over four hundred miles  
of lime, dishonorable in the mind, absence,

of you too, I make my claim.  
In the far away land of Desolation a lone hyena

paws through a gone season’s kill -- bleach,  
tooth and bone, hollowed up, cinched in the flanks.

Here, an ostrich neither runs nor ducks its head,  
but wastes to a feather and, O for a breeze, to at last take flight.
