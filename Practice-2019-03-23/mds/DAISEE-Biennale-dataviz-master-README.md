# Biennale-dataviz

Simple Flask-based website allowing to visualize energy consumption and production during the [Biennale Internationale Design Saint-Etienne](http://www.biennale-design.com/saint-etienne/2017/fr/home/). Data are read from the [CitizenWatt API](https://github.com/CitoyensCapteurs/CitizenWatt-Base) or from [emonCMS API](https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms) and displayed with [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) (with 2 plugins : [leaflet.heat](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.heat) and [leaflet.migrationLayer](https://github.com/react-map/leaflet.migrationLayer)).
