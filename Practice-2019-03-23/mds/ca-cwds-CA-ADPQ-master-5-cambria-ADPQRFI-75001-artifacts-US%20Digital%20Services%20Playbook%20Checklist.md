# U.S. DIGITAL SERVICES PLAYBOOK CHECKLIST

  Our GitHub repository, along with our prototype and related documentation, show how we utilized the US Services Digital Playbook. For the purposes of illustration, we have identified and checked those items in the checklist that we incorporated during the agile build of our application.
  
  
  1. UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE NEED
  
  We used user interviews, scholarly research, and user feedback to inform our design and we also tested throughout all phases of the process using real people. After our first user interaction meeting, we identified our target audience and their most pertinent needs by developing personas.
  
  [x] Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service
  
  [ ] Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent
  
  [x] Test prototypes of solutions with real people, in the field if possible
  
  [x] Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
  
  [x] Share findings with the team and agency leadership
  
  [x] Create a prioritized list of tasks the user is trying to accomplish, also known as "user stories"
  
  [x] As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets people’s needs

  2. ADDRESS THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE FROM START TO FINISH
  
 We focused on creating a streamline one-stop shop that allows parents of foster kids to streamline how they access tools and also ensured that the application was easy to use on multiple devices including android, iPhone, iPad, and tablet.
  
  [x] Understand the different points at which people will interact with the service – both online and in person
  
  [ ] Identify pain points in the current way users interact with the service, and prioritize these according to user needs
  
  [x] Design the digital parts of the service so that they are integrated with the offline touch points people use to interact with the service
  
  [x] Develop metrics that will measure how well the service is meeting user needs at each step of the service
  
  User Feedback: https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/ADPQRFI-75001/blob/master/artifacts/User%20Feedback.pdf
  
  
  3. MAKE IT SIMPLE AND INTUITIVE
  
 We understood that the style guide significantly impacts the way users feel about their interactive experience. In developing it, we prioritized the use of inspirational pictures, an empathetic tone, persona based branding, and being intuitive and relevant. We focused on consistency and flow of content for easy and intuitive reading, and created a plan that allows the user to engage with the right amount of information at the right time.
 
  [ ] Use a simple and flexible design style guide for the service. Use the U.S. Web Design Standards as a default
  
  [x] Use the design style guide consistently for related digital services
  
  [x] Give users clear information about where they are in each step of the process
  
  [ ] Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service
  
  [x] Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process
  
  [x] Use language that is familiar to the user and easy to understand
  
  [x] Use language and design consistently throughout the service, including online and offline touch points

  4. BUILD THE SERVICE USING AGILE AND ITERATIVE PRACTICES
  
  Our iterative approach was informed by feedback from subsequent versions throughout all phases of the prototype development. We had daily standup meetings where we discussed what was done the previous day, what the plan was for the current day and any blockers that needed to be addressed. We conducted a total of six sprints that each had a sprint planning session, and reviewed retrospectives. We also ran usability tests throughout, and collected feedback from usability testing sessions. The product manager provided feedback for prioritizing adjustments which we applied to the upcoming sprint. We added features with each sprint and fixed prioritized issues.	
  
  [x] Ship a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that solves a core user need as soon as possible, no longer than three months from the beginning of the project, using a “beta” or “test” period if needed
  [x] Run usability tests frequently to see how well the service works and identify improvements that should be made
  
  [x] Ensure the individuals building the service communicate closely using techniques such as launch meetings, war rooms, daily standups, and team chat tools
  
  [x] Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners
  
  [ ] Release features and improvements multiple times each month
  
  [x] Create a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as the “feature backlog” and “bug backlog”
  
  [x] Use a source code version control system
  
  [x] Give the entire project team access to the issue tracker and version control system
  
  [x] Use code reviews to ensure quality

  8. CHOOSE A MODERN TECHNOLOGY STACK
  
  We built our solution on a foundation of modern open-source tools and technologies that facilitated collaboration between members of our cross-disciplinary team. The technology we selected also offered ease in rapid prototyping and iteration without compromising the stability of the end product.
  
  [x] Choose software frameworks that are commonly used by private-sector companies creating similar services
  
  [x] Whenever possible, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types
  
  [x] Ensure that each project has clear, understandable instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects
  
  [x] Consider open source software solutions at every layer of the stack

  Technical approach; see requirement (j): https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/ADPQRFI-75001/blob/master/README.md
  
  
  10.	AUTOMATED TESTING AND DEPLOYMENTS
  
  We chose to use Pytest for unit testing as it ensures logic is working as expected and regressions do not creep in. For functional tests, we used Webtest in order to simulate real user interactions with the website, which allowed us to incorporate test feedback reducing the burden on the test team.
  
  [x] Create automated tests that verify all user-facing functionality
  
  [x] Create unit and integration tests to verify modules and components
  
  [x] Run tests automatically as part of the build process
  
  [x] Perform deployments automatically with deployment scripts, continuous delivery services, or similar techniques

  Technical approach; see requirement (k): https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/ADPQRFI-75001/blob/master/README.md
  
  
  11.	MANAGE SECURITY AND PRIVACY THROUGH REUSABLE PROCESSES
  
  NOT APPLICABLE
  
  
  12.	USE DATA TO DRIVE DECISIONS
  
  We used Librato for continuous monitoring because it is a complete solution that monitors and analyzes the metrics that impact the application at every level of the stack. We integrated Librato with Heroku to provide detailed information about the application’s performance. We added LogEntries to provide real-time logging, aggregated live-tail search and context views, and the ability to search events as they occur.
  
  [x] Monitor system-level resource utilization in real-time
  
  [x] Monitor system performance in real-time (e.g. response time, latency, throughput, and error rates)
  
  [ ] Ensure monitoring can measure median, 95th percentile, and 98th percentile performance
  
  [x] Create automated alerts based on this monitoring
  
  [ ] Track concurrent users in real-time, and monitor user behaviors in the aggregate to determine how well the service meets user needs
  
  [x] Publish metrics internally
  
  [ ] Publish metrics externally
  
  [x] Use an experimentation tool that supports multivariate testing in production
  
  Technical approach; see requirement (n): https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/ADPQRFI-75001/blob/master/README.md
  
  
  13.	DEFAULT TO OPEN
  
  In creating this prototype, we used exclusively open source technologies and the prototype itself is also openly licensed and free of charge.
  
  [x] Offer users a mechanism to report bugs and issues, and be responsive to these reports
  
  [ ] Provide datasets to the public, in their entirety, through bulk downloads and APIs (application programming interfaces)
  
  [x] Ensure that data from the service is explicitly in the public domain, and that rights are waived globally via an international public domain dedication, such as the “Creative Commons Zero” waiver
  
  [ ] Catalog data in the agency’s enterprise data inventory and add any public datasets to the agency’s public data listing
  
  [ ] Ensure that we maintain the rights to all data developed by third parties in a manner that is releasable and reusable at no cost to the public
