# Welcome.

Are all media sources equally truthful? As we all know from the headlines we read every day, the answer is clearly no. But, does that mean finding truth is hopeless, that we are lost with no trustworthy statements among the millions of words published every day? Fortunately, the answer to that question is also no. While filtering pure reporting from pure storytelling is difficult, it's certainly doable, and we're here to help.

Important information about different news sources can be inferred from the ways that they connect with other sources and from the subjects of their reporting. We've built a tool that enables you to explore reporting trends of some of the most influential media sources in the world. Needless to say, we love it, but rather than boring you with yet more words for you to read, we'll let you check it our for yourself:
