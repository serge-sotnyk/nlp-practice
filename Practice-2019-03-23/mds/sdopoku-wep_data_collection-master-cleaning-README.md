## Data Cleaning and Validation Process

### Data Collection Overview
WEP, together with Open Knowledge International, trained data collectors on 28th and 29th July 2016. On 1st -9th August 2016 (7 working days), data collectors went into the communities to collect information about status of infrastructure using the [Kobo Toolbox data collection kit](http://www.kobotoolbox.org). 20 data collectors were to collect data from 160 communities across 32 wards of the three Area Councils of AMAC, Gwagwalada and Kuje. A total of 2 responses each were expected from each community totaling 320 expected responses. At the end of the 7-working days data collection exercise, 333 responses were collected.

### Validation Process
To validate the data, WEP staff went through the database to validate:
- How many responses came from each community ?
- How many responses came from each ward ?
- How many responses came from each Area Council ?
- And how many responses came from each data collector ?
- How many responses were duplicate entries ?
- Were the communities are placed appropriately against their wards and Area Councils ?

After perusing the database, we found that out of the 333 responses received, 5 were responses from test survey prior to the commencement of the survey: 4 on 31st July and one at 8:09 am on 1st August. This was due to preliminary test collection done by one data collector.

### Area Council Validation

#### Abuja Municipal Area Council

- Abacha Barracks community had 3 entries. In addition to these, there was another entry as Mogadishu Contonement community (which is the same as Abacha Barracks community).
- Presidential Villa community appeared under  Aso Villa and so it has been corrected to Presidential Villa to reflect the name in the Independent National Electoral Commission Revised Directory of Polling Units, 2015, which is the source for our classification of communities.
- O.V.A Camp 2 appeared under the name OVA mambila barracks in 2 entries and has been corrected to O.V.A Camp 2.
- Apo village was uploaded as Pigba Apo Village under Garki Ward in AMAC. This has been corrected
Lugbe FHA was just written as FHA. But the ward (Kabusa) it came under help to distinguish it from other FHAs. This has been adjusted too.
- Zone 4 community under Wuse ward in AMAC was written as Agric quarters, zone 4. This has been corrected to Wuse Zone 4.
- Wuse zone 2  was submitted as Ministerial Quarters and has been corrected after following up with enumerators.
- There were 4 entries for Nyanya FHA community under Nyanya ward in AMAC. The first two extra were deleted since they were duplications of the 3rd submission. The community name was corrected from FHA to Nyanya FHA
- There were 2 entries as Ministerial Quarters, under Wuse ward in AMAC. This was investigated further from the enumerators and was discovered that it refers to Wuse Zone 2 community. This has been corrected..
- Area 3 community was not attributed to any area council or ward. Records show that it belongs to AMAC and City Centre ward. This has been updated. We followed up with the data collector assigned to find out how he managed to submit an entry without the required area council and ward fields.


#### Kuje Area Council
- Pasli community was uploaded under Gwargwada ward. But there is no community like that under Gwargwada ward and so it is deleted.
- Kabi Mangoro community in Kuje Area Council was uploaded under Gaube ward in the Area Council but have been reversed to Kabi ward.
- Bida community under Kujekwa ward in Kuje was uploaded under Gaube ward. This has been reversed
Gumayi community was called Guwayi in the submissions and was uploaded under Kwakwu instead of Kabi ward in Kuje Area Council. This has been reversed.
- Agwai community was misspelled as Akwai and  was also uploaded under Kwaku ward instead of Kabi in Kuje Area council. This has been reversed.
- Tude community in Kabi ward is not captured in the responses but captured on gps. Although responses ought not to be received from it as it is not among the list of communities to be surveyed. Tude community was not part of the communities that ought to be surveyed at all, and it was not surveyed.
- Kabi Kasa  was misspelled as Kabin Kasa and is uploaded under Kwaku ward instead of Kabi ward in Kuje Area Council. And there are 3 entries for Kabi Kasa. 1 entry is therefore deleted and the entry reversed to the appropriate ward.
- Dnago community under Yenche ward was uploaded to Rubochi ward. They have been changed to Yenche ward.
- Tusha community in Gwargwada ward was also uploaded to Rubochi ward. It has been changed to Gwargwada ward.
- Zokutu in Rubochi has only 1 entry under Rubochi and the other entry was uploaded to Yenche ward. It has been corrected.
- 1 record for Chibiri community was uploaded under Kuje ward instead of Chibiri ward. This has been corrected.
- Responses were received from Kiyi community in Chibiri ward. This community was not to be surveyed. Only 4 communities were to be surveyed in this ward. The data collectors admitted they surveyed Kiyi because at their first outing they could not access one of the communities they were supposed to survey in Chibiri ward and then picked Kiyi for replacement. But later they were shown another route that bypass that river that posed as their obstacle. Kiyi has therefore been kept.
- Gude community in Gaube ward has 4 entries instead of 2. 4 different responses were collected from this community. The team members responsible for this explain there was miscommunication which led to them surveying the same community more than once. The extra entries are therefore kept.
- Gwaupe community in Gaube ward did not receive any response, even though it ought to have been done. For Gwaupe community in gaube ward, we learnt from the team leader that they could not access it due to large volume of water in the river that you have to cross before getting to Gwaupe community.
- Submission for gambo and gbambo communities were made under Yenche ward but there is no record of such communities in the survey list. One copy was kept.

#### Gwagwalada Area Council
- Two entries were made for Ibwa II and Ibuwa II which represent the same community, Ibwa Sarki. These have been corrected.
- Ungwan Sarki Dobi has 4 entries instead of 2 but have been kept. These entries were collected by Isso Solomon. The data collector responsible for this community admitted collecting 4 responses from this community.
- Under Zuba ward in Gwagwalada Area Council, a response was received from a community with only the letter **a** as its name. As it was difficult to know which community exactly is this, we have deleted the response.
- 3 responses were also received from Ungwan kasa community under Zuba ward in Gwagwalada. The responses have all been kept.
- Sabon kasuwa community under Zuba ward was supposed to have been surveyed but was not surveyed.
- Kaida tsoho in Dobi ward was not surveyed as the data collectors reported that there was no one living in the community

### Value Mapping

- For question on occupation, database values were wrongly mapped. This happened because the question was copied from previous question on role in community.  Answers  in the database are therefore  not reflective of what is selected in survey. The correct mapping of values was obtained by looking at the original survey schema in Kobo Toolbox. The correct mapping in the database is as follows:
  1. community_head -> civil_service
  - youth_leader -> business
  - women_leader -> student
