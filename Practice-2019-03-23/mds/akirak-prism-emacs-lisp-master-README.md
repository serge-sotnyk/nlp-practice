# Emacs Lisp Support for Prism.js

**Deprecation notice**: The Emacs Lisp plugin in this repository has been hugely rewritten by [@JuanCaicedo](https://github.com/JuanCaicedo) and merged into the code base of [Prism.js](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism). I suggest you use `lisp` plugin shipped with Prism.js rather than the original version in this repository.

This repository contains the following things:

- Emacs Lisp language support for [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com/)
- [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme for Prism.js with extensive support for the language

To highlight code written in Emacs Lisp, you have to add `language-emacs` class to each `code`/`pre` tag.
