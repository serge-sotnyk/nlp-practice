### Learnings about Statistics

- Measures of mean & standard deviation:
  - mean, etc.
  - CONS:
  	- mean/average is easily affected by outliers, so not always a good representation of the data. If this deviates from measures of spread, then we know the dataset contains lots of outliers.
- Measures of spread:
  - median (center datapoint), quartiles (Q1=1/4, Q2=1/2, Q3=3/4 datapoints), interquatile range (Q3-Q1)
  - PROS:
    - "Quartiles are a useful measure of spread because they are much less affected by outliers or a skewed data set than the equivalent measures of mean and standard deviation. For this reason, quartiles are often reported along with the median as the best choice of measure of spread and central tendency, respectively, when dealing with skewed and/or data with outliers. A common way of expressing quartiles is as an interquartile range." ([link](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/measures-of-spread-range-quartiles.php))
