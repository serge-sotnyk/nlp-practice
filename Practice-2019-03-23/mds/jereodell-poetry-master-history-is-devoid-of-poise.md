# "History is devoid of poise"

When he finished reading the book, he tied it with a strap  
to a stone and heaved it deep into the Euphrates.

The river moved as the river always moved  
and the beasts came there in the heat to wade and drink.

A season passed and another and another and every page  
slipped loose the binds, and of every word was made

the blood of the earth, lurching to the core  
and pumped back to the orb of her great blue eye.

Yes, prophet, we are cursed, but who are kept for a day,  
but who wait upon her mercy in such a gaze.
