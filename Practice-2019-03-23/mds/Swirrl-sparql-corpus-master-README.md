# SPARQL Query Corpus

This repository contains a corpus of SPARQL queries assembled from various
places (mainly a set of queries generated by PMD and some hand written queries)

The corpus currently includes just queries (no sample data).

# Why have this corpus?

It is useful to have a set of queries to test SPARQL processing, parsing, and
round-tripping.
